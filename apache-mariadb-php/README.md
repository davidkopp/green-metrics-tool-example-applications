## Introduction
This orchestration is based on the official images of [MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb)
and [PHP](https://hub.docker.com/_/php)

If you need more modules in your PHP installation please refer to their documentation
how to install them.

In our Dockerfile you see an example of how to install `mysqli`

## Using this example application.

In this application we provide no sample `usage_scenario.json`.

It is just a demo app that shows how to containerize your architecture from scratch if you are in a Apache-PHP-MariaDB setup.
