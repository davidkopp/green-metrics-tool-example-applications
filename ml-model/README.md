# Introduction

This is an example on how to run a simple ML application and measure its metrics.

## Building

Run `docker compose build` to build the containers and use them for testing or  
instrumented by the Green Metrics Tool runner.

## Running

Please consider setting `flow-process-runtime` in the `config.yml` of the Green Metrics Tool to  
120 seconds, or higher depending on your machine.
