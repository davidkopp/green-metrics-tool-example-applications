## WordPress vs. HUGO

These sample applications compare a very simple Wordpress website with the 
default template to a copy of that website generated with HUGO.

The research question is to compare the energy for accessing a Wordpress site
vs. a static site from HUGO.

Additionally we have looked at the energy for generating the HUGO page in the build
process, so check out the https://github.com/green-coding-berlin/wordpress-static
repository.


## Measurements

You can find all the measurements on https://metrics.green-coding.org/ by searching
for the repository URL.

If you want to run the measurements locally to falsify be sure to append the 
`--allow-unsafe` flag if you are measuring the **wordpress-minimal** site.


## Case Studies
